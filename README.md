This is an approach to a fully transparent, but highly secure and anonymous blockchain "internet".

# Why the internet is not enough

> We know that ISPs, governments and big data collection firms just love snooping on and storing our traffic for God-knows-what. Sure, you may not think you care. That is, until youâ€™re surfing information on a personal medical condition or advice on teen pregnancy. Whose business is that? That information is always useful to someone, which is why they want it and keep it. Forever.

As a young enthusiastic developer, I am very convinced that the lack of privacy and
anonymity in today's Internet, as well as its monetization, should be addressed.
When I first met internet restrictions on one of my vacations and not even my VPN provider
was able to help I struggled looking for a solution. Luckily, TOR helped me out this time.
But, it won't every time. And when I took a second look at its concepts, I wasn't 100%
convinced.

Therefore, I ran home and created a blueprint. A draft. I'd love to share my idea with
people around the world at this point. Because as more and more people will join in
it will gain in security, privacy and trust. I am sure.

# Blueprint

The idea was to never leave a secure (and anonymous) network at all. This way TLS could
even be expanded to an end to end encryption. And in my very personal opinion it's not a
shame to be transparent. Everything belongs to everyone. Sharing is caring.
